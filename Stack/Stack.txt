### All About Stack
## a stack is an abstract data type (ADT)
- defines what the data is and what you can do with it, but not how it is stored or manipulated.
## is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure.
- the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.
## Operations
# Push
- adds an element to the top of the stack
# Pop
- removes the top element from the stack.
# Peek
- returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
## Applications
# expression evaluation
- a stack can be used to evaluate arithmetic expressions by storing operators
  and operands in the stack and then performing operations in the correct order
  based on their precedence and associativity.
# Recursion
- a stack can be used to keep track of function calls and return values
# backtracking algorithms
- a stack can be used to keep track of the search path and to backtrack to previous states when necessary.
