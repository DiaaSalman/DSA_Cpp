## All about Linear Search
### also known as sequential search
### Complexity
#### Time => O(n) for average and worst - O(1) for the best
#### Space => O(1) 
- the amount of memory required by the algorithm does not depend on the size of the input.
- the space required is constant regardless of the size of the list or array being searched.
