## All about Binary Search
### is divide and conquer algorithm
### to implement this algoritm the array you search in must be sorted
### Complexity
#### Time => O(log(n)) 
- as the size of the input increases, the number of comparisons required to find 
  the target value grows logarithmically.
#### Space => O(1)
- the amount of memory required by the algorithm does not depend on the size of the input.
- the space required is constant regardless of the size of the list or array being searched.
